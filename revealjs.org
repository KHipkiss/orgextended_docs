* Reveal JS / Presenations
  I have often used Reveal JS for presentations.
  I find having a simple web based format that doesn't require a powerpoint player to be quite convenient. 

  The reveal exporter will convert a simple org heading layout to a set of slides in an html file, with a variety of styles.

  My exporter is NOT as elaborate as the full emacs exporter
  but it does a reasonable job building a presentation.

** Themes
   Reveal JS supports a set of builtin themes. These can be controlled with an orgmode comment as follows:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
     #+REVEAL_THEME: league  
   #+END_EXAMPLE 

  Source block highlights can also be controlled in this manner:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #+REVEAL_HIGHLIGHT: zenburn   
   #+END_EXAMPLE  

   Most of these types of comments have a sublime config file equivalent:
   - REVEAL_THEME: RevealTheme
   - REVEAL_HIGHLIGHT: RevealHighlight 
   - REVEAL_VLEVEL: RevealVLevel

** Per Slide Properties
   Reveal supports a wide variety of per slide properties. These can be specified by properties
   in a property drawer. See the reveal documentation for more information.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   	:PROPERTIES:
	:reveal_background: images/name-of-image
	:reveal_background_size: width-of-image
	:reveal_background_trans: slide
	:END:   
   #+END_EXAMPLE
