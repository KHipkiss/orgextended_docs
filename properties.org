* Properties

  One of the many things that sets org mode files apart from markdown are properties, comments and drawers. 
  These are meta data that will not get exported with an orgmode file, but control the appearance and behaviour of
  many subsystems. 

** Settings

   Org Mode has a ton of in buffer settings, these work hand in hand with properties to control the behaviour of the document. 

   In addition settings can provide special parameters for export:
   Some examples of these include:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     EXPORT_LATEX
     ATTR_HTML
     ATTR_LATEX
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Part of the challenge of learning to use orgmode effectively is learning the common settings and export settings that are available to you.
   Where possible we support the common Org Mode settings, although our coverage is limited to what we are able to support and the capabilities of sublime.

** Drawers
  
   Drawers are a first class generic feature of orgmode. They are a collapsible mechanism that are not exported with an orgmode file.
   Drawers have a ton of uses. They can be used for presenters notes, I have seen writers use them for their chapter notes when writing a book, they are useful for meta data.
   Tracking and estimating details, logs and many other purposes.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     :DRAWER:   //< Drawers start with something that looks like a tag
      // ANYTHING CAN GO IN HERE
     :END:
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Drawers will collapse by default and should always appear right after a heading.

*** Properties
    Org Mode has 2 special drawers. The first of which is the property drawer. Property drawers are just a drawer with a special name.
    Properties live in a property drawer and are key value pairs. These values can be use in table formulas to hold IDs that can reference a heading uniquely,
    column view, estimates, clocking, and in many other applications.

    A classic org mode example of using properties is in an address book or cd collection.
    Properties can act like queryable fields for each record. The org manual link below
    shows a quick example from a cd collection.

   Org Extended has a powerful insertion tool:

    Org Mode itself has other tools. If you find you have a need for these please
    request them or setup a PR.

*** LogBook
The second property drawer that is well know to org mode enthusiasts is that of the
LOGBOOK. The logbook is used to contain clocking information and TODO state changes,
especially for recurring tasks. When a recurring task is set to done through the state
change commands, the timestamp is reset to the next occurence and the task stays open
in the TODO state. The completion of the task is logged to the logbook.

The same sort of behaviour is true for clocking. Clock data is written to the logbook.

** Clock info
  TODO - Fill this in.
