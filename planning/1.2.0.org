* 1.2.0 - Full Table Alpha
  My goal here is to remove the Preview moniker from tables. That said some of the work will be
  outside of pure table support but rather be about building the start of our babel feature.

  The "big reveal" of 1.2.0 is going to be this:

*** Planned Releases
**** DONE 1.1.27 - Extending Date Formula Support
**** TODO 1.1.28 - Core Performance and Quality of Life
**** TODO 1.1.29 - GNU Plot Script Blocks
**** TODO 1.1.30 - Table Babel
**** TODO 1.2.0  - RELEASE
 
** DONE 1.1.27 
    Core Idea: Extending datetime formula support
               you should be able to make the table the guy shows in the video
               with some "OrgExtended" flair to make it easier.
*** Ian Goals
   I am working towards this as my ultimate goal
   [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ViUBaarsbw][Gantt Charts In Org]] 
 
   For 1.1.26 I am hoping to have the full creation of the table
   functional, but with some added bells and whistles that allow
   you to create that table dynamically directly in the columnview
   rather than having to build the table every time you want a gantt chart.
 
   - [x] Support adding formulas to the generated table in the columnview description somehow
   - [x] Support adding non existent columns in the columnview description (probably just property markers)
   - [x] Support date() parsing cells
   - [x] Support OrgDate converting back to a string properly
   - [x] Support OrgDate + OrgDuration additions so you do not have to remove the d from the effort estimate.
   - [x] Support percentage strings
   - [-] Support if statement in tables 
 
*** 1.1.27 Documentation Goals
   - [x] Document advanced tables
   - [x] Audit other major features that I might have forgotten?
 
** 1.1.28 
    Core Idea: Table Performance and Quality of Life
               I should feel like the table feature is not needlessly expensive
               and I can use it for babel.
*** Ian Goals
 	- [x] Improve function table creation times. Can we cache this?
 	- [x] Test table cache across multiple files?
 	- [x] Create symbol parsing cache?
 	- [x] Turn off highlight durng execution view updates
 	- [x] Create table from node vs view (improve remote function) - *Important for babel*
 	- [x] Cleanup table? Move plot out of table file?
 	- [x] Cleanup table? Hoist any utility functions?
 	- [x] Cleanup table? Improve parameter parser around quotes?
 	- [x] Support extensible symbols as well as functions.
   - [x] Add GnuPlot syntax
 
*** Documentation Goals
   - [x] Document all available functions (using a TextCommand) (can we create docstrings for this and pull from that?)
   - [x] Document all available symbols
   - [ ] Add docstrings to all functions.
 
** 1.1.29
   Core Idea: Add GNU Plot Script Blocks

   - [x] Add a syntax for gnu plot script blocks if one does not already exist
   - [ ] Add a src handler to execute these script blocks.
   - [ ] Any prep/improvements I feel is necessary to support setting up for table source data and babel work

*** Documentation Goals
	- [ ] Write a tool to dump out the list of supported script blocks to our docs.
	- [ ] Add that to our script block page.

** 1.1.30
	Core Idea: Table Babel

*** Ian Goals
	- [ ] Support tables as data sources for babel

	--> More research required here as to the full list of tasks.

*** Documentation Goals
	- [ ] Table Babel Demo

** 1.2.0
*** Ian Goals
	- [ ] Add match feature to columnview?
	
*** Documentation Goals
	- [ ] Gantt chart demo page.
