* Column Mode

	Emacs has a lovely means of editing properties on all headings in a file.
	This is called column mode. It is implemented as an overlay on a buffer... which means... we can't do it in sublime.

	Right now my thought is that we might implement it with phantoms and the input panel. We might do as follows:

	- Flip to a column fold of the document
	- Insert phantoms at every heading that have the table elements
	- Support cursor navigation of the phantoms with the input panel representing the active cell.
	- Dynamically update the folded properties as we go.

	It's lame, but it's the best idea I have right now.
