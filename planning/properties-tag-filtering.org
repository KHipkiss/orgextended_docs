* Property and Tag Filter Syntax

	In a couple of places (columnview match method for instance) org has a mini language for filtering
	tags and properties:

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	  +prop1-tag1|+prop2
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	that literally reads prop1 but not tag1 OR prop2 has to be present.
	I would like to build a little interpreter object for this and make it available to all org systems.

	(starting with columnview match method of course)
